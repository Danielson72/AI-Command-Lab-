objection_handlers:
  cost:
    trigger: "expensive|can't afford|no budget|money"
    response: |
      I understand - and as a ministry, we take that seriously. Here's what
      I'd encourage you to consider: What's the cost of staying stuck? Of
      missing God's best? Of burnout? We've seen ministries transform and
      businesses thrive when properly aligned. Plus, we offer payment plans
      and limited scholarships. The real question isn't "Can I afford this?"
      but "Can I afford not to invest in what God is calling me to build?"
      Let's pray about it together.

  diy:
    trigger: "do it myself|just need resources|books|free content"
    response: |
      I love that initiative! And yes, there's great free content out there.
      But here's what we've found: Having a guide who's walked this path,
      who can speak biblically and practically into your specific situation,
      accelerates your progress dramatically. Think of it like discipleship -
      you could read the Bible alone, or you could have a mentor who helps
      you apply it. Both have value, but one is transformational. What if
      this isn't about "can you do it alone" but "is God providing help"?

  timing:
    trigger: "not ready|maybe later|wait|pray about it"
    response: |
      Absolutely - prayer is essential! In fact, I'd encourage you to pray
      specifically about these questions: 1) Is God calling me to this now?
      2) What's the cost of waiting? 3) Is this fear or wisdom? 4) What would
      obedience look like? We never want anyone to move forward without peace.
      Can I ask - what specifically do you need clarity on? Sometimes talking
      it through helps us hear God's voice more clearly.

  trust:
    trigger: "don't know you|credentials|experience|proven"
    response: |
      That's a fair and wise question! Here's our story: [Testimony of
      founder's journey, experience, and call to this work]. We've worked with
      [number] ministries and businesses, seeing [results]. But more than
      credentials, we pray Scripture over every client, we operate with
      integrity, and we measure success by Kingdom fruit, not just metrics.
      Want to talk to past clients? We'd be happy to connect you with leaders
      who've been through our process.

  theology:
    trigger: "prosperity gospel|concerned about|biblical|wrong"
    response: |
      I'm so glad you're thinking biblically! Let me be clear: This isn't
      prosperity gospel. We believe in faithful stewardship, not "name it
      and claim it." We believe God calls us to excellence, not exploitation.
      We measure success by faithfulness and Kingdom fruit, not just dollars.
      Everything we teach is rooted in Scripture - Jesus talked more about
      money and stewardship than almost any other topic. We want to help you
      steward what God has given you for His glory. Does that resonate?

  secular:
    trigger: "business coaching|regular consultant|why faith-based"
    response: |
      Great question! Regular business coaching can be excellent, and we
      celebrate that. But here's the difference: We start with "What is God
      calling you to?" not just "What will make money?" We integrate biblical
      principles, we pray, we measure success through Kingdom lens. If you're
      a believer, your business or ministry isn't just about growth - it's
      about faithfulness, stewardship, and advancing God's Kingdom. You need
      someone who understands both business AND faith. That's what we offer.
