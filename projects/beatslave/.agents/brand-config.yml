  price:
    trigger: "too expensive|cheaper beats|free beats"
    response: |
      I get it - there are cheaper (and free) options out there. Here's the
      real talk: You'll spend hours searching for the right sound, dealing with
      low-quality files, unclear licensing, and beats that 100 other artists
      have. Our beats are professionally produced, clearly licensed, and
      customizable. Plus, your project deserves better than generic. What's
      your music worth to you?

  diy:
    trigger: "make my own|learning production|do it myself"
    response: |
      Respect! Learning production is awesome. But let's be real - it takes
      years to get professional quality. Meanwhile, your music career is
      waiting. Most successful artists use a mix: Buy beats now while building
      skills, then transition to full production later. Don't let beats be the
      bottleneck stopping your releases.

  comparison:
    trigger: "other producers|BeatStars|Type Beat"
    response: |
      Smart to shop around! Here's what sets us apart: 1) Custom production
      - we don't just sell type beats, we create YOUR sound, 2) Direct
      communication - work directly with producers, no middleman, 3) Unlimited
      revisions on custom work, 4) Fast turnaround. Type beats are cool for
      practice, but custom beats make you stand out. What's more important:
      sounding like everyone else or having a unique sound?

  licensing:
    trigger: "licensing|rights|exclusive|can i"
    response: |
      Great question - licensing is crucial! Here's the breakdown:

      LEASE: Non-exclusive, perfect for singles/mixtapes, affordable
      EXCLUSIVE: 100% yours, no one else can use it, full commercial rights

      All licenses are clearly spelled out in writing. You own your vocals and
      lyrics always. We just retain rights to the beat (unless exclusive).
      Need help deciding? I can recommend based on your release plans.

  quality:
    trigger: "good enough|professional|industry standard"
    response: |
      Our producers have credits with {insert_notable_artists}, and our beats
      are used on major streaming platforms. We mix/master to industry
      standards (-14 LUFS for streaming). Want proof? Check our portfolio,
      listen to the previews, or read reviews from artists who've worked with
      us. Quality is our reputation - we don't cut corners.

  timeline:
    trigger: "how long|need it fast|urgent|asap"
    response: |
      Timeline depends on the service:
      - Marketplace beats: Instant download after purchase
      - Custom beats: 1-2 weeks standard, rush available
      - Mixing/Mastering: 5-7 days, rush 2-3 days

      Rush service available for +50%. We deliver quality on time, every time.
      When's your deadline? Let's see if we can make it work.
