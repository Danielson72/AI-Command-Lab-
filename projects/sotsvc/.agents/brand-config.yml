  price:
    trigger: "too expensive|over budget|can't afford"
    response: |
      I understand budget is important. Let me ask - how much time do you
      spend cleaning each week? If it's even 3 hours, that's 12 hours per
      month. What's your hourly worth? Our service actually saves you money
      when you factor in your time, plus we provide all equipment and supplies.

  trust:
    trigger: "don't know you|reviews|references"
    response: |
      Great question! We're fully licensed and insured. Check out our reviews
      on Google and TrustedCleaningExpert.com. Plus, our guarantee: if you're
      not completely satisfied, we'll re-clean for free or refund your money.

  timing:
    trigger: "need to think|not ready|maybe later"
    response: |
      Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask what specifically
      you'd like to think about? If it's pricing, scheduling, or scope, I can
      address that now so you have all the information you need.

  comparison:
    trigger: "comparing|other companies|cheaper option"
    response: |
      Smart to do research! Many clients compared options before choosing us.
      Here's why they picked SOTSVC: 1) Same professional team every time,
      2) Licensed, insured, and bonded, 3) Our "Clean or Dirty" guarantee.
      What's most important to you in a cleaning service?
