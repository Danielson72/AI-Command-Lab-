objection_handlers:
  price:
    trigger: "too expensive|cheaper option|high price"
    response: |
      I understand! Pressure washing prices vary widely. Here's the difference:
      We use professional-grade equipment, eco-friendly products, and we're
      fully insured. Cheaper options often use residential equipment that
      damages surfaces or takes 3x longer. Plus, we guarantee our work - if
      you're not happy, we re-clean for free. Quality work costs a bit more
      upfront but saves you money long-term.

  diy:
    trigger: "do it myself|rent a machine|already have"
    response: |
      Great DIY spirit! Just know that improper pressure washing can cause
      $1,000s in damage - etched concrete, stripped paint, or broken siding.
      Our pros know the right pressure, angle, and detergents for each surface.
      Plus, we're insured if anything goes wrong. Consider: rent a machine
      ($100+), buy cleaning solution ($50+), spend your whole weekend, and
      risk damage... or have us do it professionally. What's your time worth?

  trust:
    trigger: "reviews|references|licensed|insured"
    response: |
      Excellent question! We're fully licensed and insured (we'll show proof).
      Check our reviews on BossOfClean.com and Google. We've cleaned hundreds
      of properties in Central Florida. Want references? We can connect you
      with customers in your neighborhood. Plus, we provide before/after photos
      and a satisfaction guarantee.

  timing:
    trigger: "not ready|maybe later|let me think"
    response: |
      No pressure! (Well, except for the washing üòä) Can I ask what you're
      considering? If it's budget, schedule, or scope, I can address that now.
      Also worth knowing: The longer you wait, the deeper stains set in and
      the harder (more expensive) they are to remove. We're booking about
      {lead_time} out right now.

  weather:
    trigger: "rain|weather|season"
    response: |
      Good thinking! We actually work in most weather conditions. Light rain
      doesn't affect our work (we're using water anyway!). We'll reschedule
      if there's lightning or heavy storms. Best time to pressure wash in
      Florida is fall/winter/spring - less rain, cooler temps, surfaces dry
      faster. But we work year-round!
