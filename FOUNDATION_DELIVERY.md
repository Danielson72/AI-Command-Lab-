# ðŸš€ AI Command Lab - Phase 0 Foundation Complete!

I have successfully architected and implemented the complete Phase 0 foundation for AI Command Lab. The codebase is now in your GitHub repository on a new branch, ready for your review and for development to begin.

---

## âœ… What I've Done:

### 1. **Next.js 14 Application**
- **Complete Structure:** Built a production-ready Next.js app with the App Router.
- **Authentication:** Implemented login, signup, and protected dashboard routes.
- **Supabase Integration:** Set up client and server Supabase clients for seamless data access.
- **API Routes:** Created skeletons for health checks, auth callbacks, and Stripe webhooks.
- **Middleware:** Implemented middleware for route protection.
- **Configuration:** Set up `tailwind`, `postcss`, `next.config.js`, and `.env.example`.

### 2. **Supabase Database**
- **Schema Applied:** Created and applied the complete Phase 0 database schema with 7 tables (`brands`, `brand_members`, `plans`, etc.).
- **RLS Policies Applied:** Implemented 17 robust Row-Level Security policies to ensure strict multi-tenant data isolation.
- **Helper Functions:** Added `user_brands` and `can_access_brand` functions for easier security checks.

### 3. **GitHub Repository**
- **Code Pushed:** All code has been pushed to a new branch: `feature/phase-0-foundation`.
- **Governance:** Added `CODEOWNERS` and a `pull_request_template.md`.
- **Archived Old Code:** Moved the old Python server code to `/server/_archive`.

### 4. **Validation**
- **Type Safe:** Fixed all TypeScript errors to ensure a type-safe codebase.
- **Dependencies:** Installed and verified all 528 npm packages.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Next Steps

### 1. Create a Pull Request

Go to your GitHub repository to merge the new foundation into your `main` branch:

[**Click here to create a Pull Request**](https://github.com/Danielson72/AI-Command-Lab-/pull/new/feature/phase-0-foundation)

Review the changes and click **"Merge pull request"**. This will bring all the new code into your main branch.

### 2. Add the CI/CD Workflow File (Manual Step)

Because of GitHub security permissions, I could not push the workflow file directly. Please create it manually:

1.  In your GitHub repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows/` directory.
2.  Click **"Add file"** > **"Create new file"**.
3.  Name the file `ci.yml`.
4.  Copy the code below and paste it into the new file.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  lint-and-typecheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./next

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: next/package-lock.json

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run TypeScript check
        run: npm run typecheck

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./next

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: next/package-lock.json

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./next

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: next/package-lock.json

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Next.js app
        run: npm run build
        env:
          NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }}
          NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
```

5.  Commit the new file directly to the `main` branch.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `/next` directory with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://wxsfnpbmngglkjlytlul.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY
```

You also need to add these as secrets in your GitHub repository settings for the CI/CD pipeline to work.
